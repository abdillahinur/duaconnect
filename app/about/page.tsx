        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">How It Works</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          DuaLink offers a simple, yet powerful way to engage with others spiritually:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
          <li><strong>Share Your Duas</strong>: Post your dua requests, whether for yourself, a loved one, or the greater Muslim community. Your supplications will be seen by fellow Muslims ready to offer their prayers and support.</li>
          <li><strong>Offer Prayers</strong>: Browse through the dua requests and lend your prayers to those in need. When you find a supplication that resonates with you, offer your own dua in response and let others know you are praying for them.</li>
          <li><strong>Personalized Inspiration</strong>: For each dua you post, you will receive words of inspiration to help strengthen your faith and provide spiritual encouragement in difficult times.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
